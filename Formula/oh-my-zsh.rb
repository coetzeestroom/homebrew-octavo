  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Add Oh My Zsh to your interactive shell by appending to ~/.zshrc:

        export ZSH="#{opt_libexec}"
        source "$ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh"

      Oh My Zsh's built-in auto-updater expects a git checkout, which a
      Homebrew install is not. Add this line to ~/.zshrc to disable it and
      update via Homebrew instead (brew upgrade oh-my-zsh):

        export DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE="true"

      Runtime caches fall back to ~/.cache/oh-my-zsh rather than the
      read-only Cellar keg.
